    "The vocal performance and the bass is quite aggressive sounding for my laidback vibes playlist",

    "I think the beat would be pretty chill but honestly its too suppressed for my taste currently",
    "Oh about the rapping, its good, the rhymes and the flows you use are very engaging and it definitely makes my head nod with the beat.  good chorus. To summarize, I think production/mixing/mastering can still improve to make it sound more proffesional because thats whats missing for me, it sounds too bedroom/amateurish.	",

    "The song felt a bit weird in terms of vocal melodies and I couldnt really get in the vibe",
    "The voice is really good though",

    "I think the vocal melodies you have written are nice and the voice is good enough, and overall the song has a pretty chill vibe",

    "I like how the song is relevant with current events and it has a message",
    "I agree with the opening statement but I found it a weird sounding sample almost sounding ironic or like a parody",
    "The sample in the outro detracts from the listening experience for most casual listeners--the screaming and panic made me slightly uncomfortable, I understand that is the point of course but its something to consider",
    "The verse was good though it showed good rapping skills with great rhyme schemes",
    "The beat was pretty cool",
    "Ng has a nice light vibe",
    "Vocalist has nice flows and it sounds good, but his voice is too muffled and I cant hear what he says which is unfortunately deal breaker for me",
    "I think its a mixing decision",
    "voice does sound like it could sound really good, has kinda of a yachty sound",
    "The other more clear vocal was less unique sounding, so i do prefer the other vocals but then mixed a bit differently",
    "Anyways I think its a pretty solid song, the beat was really chill",
    "In the first verse, the rapping was a bit too simple in terms of flow and also pace, would like a bit more variation to shake it up",

    "Overall it was a good listen, I do still think you can improve your voice a bit",
    "As for the song, I thought the voice still has room for improvement especially during the verses, but other then that I thought it was very chill, very nice composition",
    "I thought the rapping was pretty good, you had fire flows and cool lyrics, but the hook I found boring pretty quickly, the work lowkey just started to bother me after a while",
    "The voice also still has some room for improvement",
    "I didnt think the voice was good enough and I also just didnt really feel this song",
    "The rapping is unique, but odd and im not really feeling it, but I do respect the uniqueness of the rapping",
    "The singing I just dont think its good enough",
    "The beat I thought was fine",
    "The beat with the sample and more gets repetitive too fast",
    "The rapping was good but pretty low-paced so it was unable to shake the repetitiveness of the beat",

    "I found the melody boring",

    "The hook is also catchy",
    "The style of the song is too different from my hip hop playlists unfortunately, so I cant add it",

    "It sounded really creative espescially with all the instruments.	",
    "I dont like the vocals of the female in the background it makes it hard to follow the rapper because its too chaotic",

    "The song is alright but it is kind of boring",
    "The beat is too tame for my taste and also doesnt really change much so I kinda lost interest",

    "Rapping is good, the production quality is high",
    "Its a nice song to drift away and just focus on the lyrics, like a story",
    "You should check it out for inspiration!	",

    "Ng goes hard",
    "Bass might be a bit too distorted but I still fw it",
    "What I liked: You used a lot of melodies in your singing/rapping and the track has a really lively sound and unique and creative sound",
    "What I disliked: The voice does not sound good enough to me, it sounds too autotuned and many parts of song/voice sounds kinda distorted and trebly",
    "I think that may be part of the style (punk? i think) that I am not really feeling",
    "its a pretty solid song but not what I have in mind for my playlist",
    "I thought the rapping was pretty good, it gave me some old school vibes, and it was easy to nod my head too",

    "Its more to do with my taste than with the quality of your music though",
    "I like the song, its really chill and you have a nice voice",

    "I thought the intro was kinda odd and I wasnt really feeling the rest of the song either",
    "The beat is kinda boring and doesnt change enough",
    "I also didnt like the parts where you sing in the high pitch I thought it sounded too weird",
    "The second verse was pretty good, the voice was also more clear in this verse than in the first verse",
    "I still think there is a lot left to improve",
    "What I liked was the voice of the rapper it sounds very intense and he has good delivery of his lines",
    "What I disliked was that the beat was kinda boring and repetitive due to how simple the lead melody is",
    "I also think the rapper should switch up his flows a bit more especially when you are on a repetitive beat like this",
    ", I feel like I hear the hook too often in the song because I kinda grew tired of it in one listen",
    "It was a solid song but there was not enough variation within this track to warrant multiple listens",

    "I wish there was more variation within the song",
    "I do think production-wise the song sounds good and also both of you have good voices so there definitely is a lot of potential",
    "Pretty nice song",

    "thats unfortunate",
    "Its an OK song but I am not really feeling it",
    "I found the theme/lyrics of the song just too generic and it didnt interest me",

    "I definitely would not have made this song 4 minutes because it does not offer enough variation within the song to keep me engaged",
    "I thought the hook was kinda boring",
    "The melody sounds pretty good but I think it gets boring because the beat stays the same the whole song and after a while, the melody loses interest",
    "The voice is decent it definitely does not sound bad but the voice does sound kinda tame and lacks something to make it stand out",
    "You should experiment with your voice more to break the monotonicity",
    "Overall this is a very solid song but it just lacks creativity and uniqueness and its very, very forgettable",
    "I think the rappings skills are definitely there",
    "vocally I think there is still room for improvement",
    "This is my opinion but I think the rappers voice is a bit too low and the rappers accent is maybe a bit too thick some parts of the song, too over pronunciated",
    "The beat of this song sounds not good it sounds kinda amateurish",
    "The vocals also put me off to be honest",
    "I think a lot needs to improve in this song too make it listenable",
    "Pretty much everything, except the rapping, the rapping was pretty good",
    "To me, the beat is kinda boring (and doesnt change enough throughout the song) and I dont think the voice is enough to carry this whole song",
    "I still think there is room for improvement both for the beatmaker and for the artist",
    "Because I dont really care for the theme of this song or its lyrics",
    "I think its a pretty decent song but I dont think it really goes hard enough",
    "Things for improvement: The rapping in the second half of the chorus sounds a bit monotonous",
    "Other than that I think its pretty good but I just dont love it",
    "The voice is pretty good, I think you made some nice verses and a good hook",
    "The beat is nice as well, its energizing and it changes up plenty to keep it fresh",
    "I enjoyed listening to this because the song sounds highly creative and has a unique vibe",
    "I thought the hook was great, and I loved how all the parts in the song differed a lot from eachother so you never really knew what was next in the song",
    "I dont like the voice of the artist during the hook",
    "The voice during the rapping of the first verse was better",
    "The beat is pretty nice, though a little repetitive",

    "For the other stuff I still think there is room for improvement",
    "I am not really feeling the voice on this track",
    "I do like that use two voices sometimes, for example during the latter half of the chorus - but I still think I need improvement in the (base) voice before I would add the song",

    "The voice of the vocalist still has a lot of room for improvement",
    "The monologue samples I was not feeling",
    "It sounds like 2008 hip hop",
    "the song went on for too long considering how the song had little variation within itself",
    "I think the first verse was my favorite",
    "The rapping was pretty good and I think you make great use of adlibs",
    "the tempo of the rapping - it doesnt really vary much, you should have some parts where you switch up the flow and rap faster",
    "Because right now I kinda lost interesting in the song at the 2 minute mark and it still went on for a minute",
    "The melody isnt interesting enough with only the piano instrument, I would use more and diverse melodical elements that have more subtlety",
    "This sounds pretty amateurish",
    "Furthermore, I dont really like the voice during the singing, the high pitch doesnt really sound good to me",
    "During the chorus, the melody of the singing matches the melody of the piano exactly which I dont think sounds good because it sounds really simple and again no subtlety or complexity",
    "The rapping was pretty good though",
    "I still think there needs to a lot of improvement",
    "The song is well written and structured",
    "The beat is really good",
    "The flows of the vocalist is great",
    "The voice of the vocalist still has a lot of room for improvement",

    "Because right now I kinda lost interesting in the song at the 2 minute mark and it still went on for a minute",
    "Its too sweet/soft/poppy compared to the rest of the rap I have in my playlist",
    "The song is alright, I like the instrumental and the song brings a lot of energy",
    "The hook lyrics are a tad cliche though",
    "And overal the song doesnt really match my taste",
    "Dont really like the effect that is on the voice",
    "Other than that its a pretty solid song but I dont think its good enough tbh, its kinda generic",
    "It was a good listen, you made a pretty chill song",
    "The pitch of the voice is too high for my taste, especially when you hit the high notes it sounds not that good and also in the hook I dont think the voice sounds that good",
    "The rapping was good though, you bring a lot of variation in terms of pace and flows, so the song stays interesting to the listener",
    "Structurally also a good song and production was also fine",
    "I still think the voice needs to improve before Id add it though, personally",
    "The intro is too long",
    "The rapping was pretty good, you bring a lot of energy and so does the beat",
    ", the beat is just way too repetitive and simple to me",
    "The only time that works is if the vocalist offers a lot of variation in his raps but I dont think that was the case here",
    "I still think there is room for improvement",
    "Voice sounded a bit unnatural (distorted/trebly)",
    "Overall the pace of the song is a bit too low for my taste",
    "I kinda lost interest in the song halfway",
    "I also feel like you kind of held on to the same flow throughout the whole song",
    "my advice would be to liven it up a bit and switch it up a bit",
    "It was a pretty interesting and unique song, but it did not sound perfect yet in my ears",
    "I think the hat that hits every beat was maybe a bit too present in this song",
    "The singing is not good enough, which was immediately clear to me when I heard the chorus",
    "The rapping was a lot better because I think rapping suits your voice better",
    "You also managed to make a pretty interesting verse, it sounded fresh",
    "I still think the voice needs to improve before I would consider adding your song, especially if you are going to sing",
    "The beat is a bit simple, but perfect too lay some bars over",
    "It does gets repetitive faster though because it lacks complexity and depth",
    "the rapping needs to be extremely good to keep the song from being repetitive",
    "And you did that pretty well, the flows you used were pretty good and you switched it up enough",
    "One big thing I dont think is good enough yet is the voice and tbh that is also the reason I didnt want to add it, also the accent didnt always sound natural",
    "I think you have the potential but can still improve in those areas",
    "Besides 6ix9ine (not a fan) I am unfamiliar with this style of hip hop so my review may not be so helpful",
    "for a screaming hip hop song I think it was pretty good, I think",
    "I definitely think the chorus hits hard and is kinda catchy",
    "good job on that",
    "The build-up at the beginning of the song is unnecessary long",
    "The chorus that follows features a very slow flow and this slow flow is being used way too long",
    "It is used during the whole first verse",
    "The low pace of the rap and the lack of switch-ups/variation in the flow makes the listener lose his interest",
    "The beat itself was also kinda repetitive so in these situations, its necessary the artist offers a lot of creativity and variation during his rapping/singing",
    "I think theres still quite some room for improvement",
    "A pretty decent, lively and energetic rap song",
    "You rap with a cool interesting flow, however, the chorus flow got boring to me pretty fast",
    "Furthermore, in the first half of the first verse the flow is kinda slow and choppy",
    "The second voice in the background does not sound that good to me, the voice sounds kinda weirdly high pitched",
    "The melody of the beat is decent but does get repetitive",
    "The ending how the beat changed was a bit odd",
    "all in all I still think there is a lot of room for improvement",
    "I think its an enjoyable song with a great climactic chorus",
    "The beat is nice and keeps a nice groove going even during the verses",
    "I think you did a good job!	",
    "The song has a good bounce, especially during the chorus it really turns into a vibe that is enjoyable to listen too the oooohooohoooh sounds very harmonic",
    "The voices are good as well, you have no trouble singing those high notes",
    "The song is a bit slow-paced for my taste but you have a good voice so it was nice to listen too",
    "This song is a chill vibe that is easy to listen to",
    "The beat is lively and bouncy and the voice is good and able to produce good high notes",

    "I especially like the bass",
    "All in all, there is a very nice soothing vibe",
    "The voice of the vocalist is pretty good too, but not amazing",
    "The song isnt exciting enough to me though",
    "Wish there was a bit more variation or something",
    "It doesnt really pique my interest, and I dont feel like I am missing out by not listening to it again",
    "the sound is, undeniably, really good",
    "The song is a bit too slow for my hip hop playlist, this is more RnB-ey",
    "The beat is a bit too slow/soft for my taste",
    "The rapping was pretty interesting, your voice manages to show a lot of range and diversity",
    "I wasnt really ever in a flow in the song though, never caught a vibe, it felt too much like a freestyle instead of a well-thought out song",
    "I like afrobeats more, this sounds too techno imo",
    "The singing was good though, you have a very good voice, but some parts I didnt really enjoy, like where you repeat a line a lot of times",
    "I am not really liking the voice, its a bit too high pitched for my liking",
    "The rapping was pretty good however",
    "The beat is fun, but the melodic lead gets repetitive pretty quick, so I think 3 minutes of this is too long",
    "not good enough but there is definitely something there",
    "I dont really like that xylophone used for the melodic lead of the beat, to me it sounds a bit amateurish",
    "For the singing and rapping, I think its decent but also did not impress me",
    ", the theme of the song, espescially the hook, is not really my taste",
    "You create a pretty chill low energy vibe",
    "I think your voice still needs to improve a bit, especially in songs such as these the quality depends pretty much completely on your voice and I dont think its on the level yet of similar artists who make songs like this, such as 6lack, Bryson Tiller, Drake, etc",
    "Structurally you made a good song, also production-wise, and the flows were good as well",
    "The hook was good as well",
    "everything is pretty much fine but I think the voice needs to improve",

    "Your voice is pleasant to listen too and you made a nice calm chorus",
    "good job",
    "Its not a bad beat but it doesnt change much throughout the song so it gets pretty repetitive",
    "The first verse is kinda tame and the flow in this verse doesnt switch up much either",
    "Halfway throughout the song (after the second verse) I felt I lost interest in the song, the chorus was already completely familiar to me and the verses both were not that interesting with pretty low pace",
    "The third verse was much better",
    "When it returned to the hook for the final time I realized I just dont think the hook is good enough",
    "Room for improvement would be to be more creative and try to keep it fresher so it doesnt get stale, both for the beat producer and for the vocalist",
    "The song is missing some stuff for me, it feels too empty during the verses",
    "I do like it when the chorus kicks in and we get some more instruments",
    "You have a nice voice especially those high notes during the chorus",
    "the rest of the song, during the verses its just a bit too slow/empty for my taste",
    "The song is pretty interesting, it sounds unique the beat and the vocalist differ a lot from traditional hip hop",
    "I cant say its my style though",
    "I cant really pinpoint what could be improved in this song, I think its just my taste that doesnt match with the song which is why I dont consider it good enough",
    "I am not really feeling the beat of this song, its just too slow to me",
    "The singing was pretty good, good voice effects, I like how you had parts where your voice had that Travis scott feel when it went low pitched",
    "yeah as mentioned, the pace is too slow in this one for me so I cant hepl but lose interetest during the song",
    "Rapping is good, good lyrics, good flows, good voice",
    ", the song never really takes off, it doesnt really go hard at any point",
    "I think its the beat that is lacking, it doesnt offer variation, it stays at one (low) pace, it should have moments where it builds up, climaxes, cools down etc",
    "I think the vocalist has a pretty nice voice and he sings quite well with a cool accent",
    "I dont really like the beat, I think the drums are too much/loud on this song and I kind of miss a nice sweet melody",
    "right now its not good enough, but on a different beat I think there is potential",
    "I am not feeling the beat of this song, especially the snare sound is what I dont like",
    "The singing is pretty good otherwise",
    "The hook was a bit repetitive though",
    "I think the most for room improvement can be found in the beat production",
    "The singing is decent, your voice sounds better when the singing gets more intense",
    "The guitar melody kind of bored me quickly, like halfway through the song",
    "The hook is pretty cool, I like the guitar during the hook and also the singing",
    "I thought the ending was pretty nice when all the instruments got more intense",
    "I am no expert on reviewing rock songs because i never listen to it",
    "I hope it was somewhat helpful",
    "This song is not good",
    "The voice is not good enough, especially noticeable during the moments were pitch is high",
    "The beat is not good enough either, espescially the melody, because its a short loop and offers little variation",
    "I think there still is a lot of room for improvement",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough",
    "Especially noticeable during the chorus when you are singing",
    "for the rapping, the voice sounds a bit too meek like it misses some power and masculinity (a trait which many seek in hip hop)",
    "The rapping was good otherwise",
    "And I think the beat was pretty good as well",
    "Its a nice song and its pleasant too listen too",
    "Nice melodies and you have a good voice",
    "The word postive energy I hear too much throughout the song though",
    "when your voice goes really high I dont think that sounds good",
    "Ng is a bit too sweet and cute for my playlist",
    "The song has a pretty chill vibe",
    "It has a good beat and I like the melodies you create with your voice during the verse and also the flows you use",
    ", I dont think your voice is good enough",
    "for that reason I dont think its good enough yet, I hope you can make improvements in that department because you got the rest down",
    "The flow in the chorus is pretty boring and the whole first verse keeps this slow boring flow going",
    "As a result it hard to stay interested in the song",
    "The voice is fine and the beat is decent as well",
    "all in all I dont think the song is exciting enough",
    "Definitely switch up the flow more (1st vocalist)",
    "For the other vocalist, the verse was pretty good, definitely more interesting, the voice was a bit high though",

    "The verses were pretty good rapping-wise",
    "Its definitely not bad but I dont think its up to the quality of the songs I feature in my playlists",
    "Really like the jazzy beat, the (blow) instrument is nice to hear",
    "The voice of the female singer is also a pleasure to listen too",
    "The drums are sounding a bit too heavy/loud for my taste",
    "For example, I really liked the parts where the singer was just singing with the instruments but the drums were cut out",
    "Overall the song really creates a nice vibe, so well done",
    "Very wavy vibe",
    "Perfect for my wavy hip hop playlist",
    "The beat was good and the rapping was good as well, good last verse.	",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough",
    ", I miss some of the lower frequencies of the voice so I think the mix/mastering is not good",

    "The rapping was good, decent flows and good lyrics",
    "All in all I dont think this song is good enough",
    "Its a decent listen, a solid 7",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough atm, it is a bit monotonous and kinda bland",
    "Same goes for the beat, its decent but not great I like the rhythm of the percussion but not the percussion sounds themselves, and for the melody I just miss something",
    "the song is an easy listen for sure, in the background, it plays nicely, but when someone wants to actively listen to it I think he may be a bit let down",
    "A chill vibe",
    "I like the melody it sounds very soft and melodic",
    "The singing is good as well",
    "I thought it was a pretty good song, a nice listen",

    "especially during the singing I feel like your voice is not good enough",
    "Obviously thats a very important factor in the song so I cant say right now that I like the song",
    "Good rapping, a lot of tempo",
    "I didnt really like the singing part that preceded the chorus",
    "The chorus is repeated one too many times, should have kept it to 8 instead of 16",
    "The post-chorus of pretty much just silence is taking the listener out of the song",
    "The song is the best when you are just rapping because you are clearly good at it",
    "Maybe you were trying to do something different I respect that but it could have been better if you just had the verses flow to the chorus which is played just once not twice and then flows back into the next verse",
    "Cutting those parts would have made the song a bit shorter as well, which is good if you want to be added to many playlists ) Well, this is just my opinion of course",
    "I liked the song when that verse kicked in halfway in the song",
    "The first half with that travis scott voice effect I wasnt really feeling that half",
    "yeah I was not really feeling the hook in this song and also not feeling the first verse",
    "Its an alright song",
    "The beat is decent",
    "I didnt like the hook because I dont think the voice of the singer is good enough",
    "I liked the verse in the middle of the song, it stood out compared to the rest of the song",
    "The song creates a pretty cool vibe",
    "Good bass and drums",
    "The singers voice I am not sure about whether I like it",
    "I liked the rappers verse",
    "Not really feeling the first beat of this song",
    "The first verse was good",
    "The hook I thought was bad, it lacked pace and energy",
    "The beat switch was interesting and I did like the second beat more",
    "The second verse was good as well",
    "What I like about this song is that it offers a lot of variation both the beat and the rapper also keeps it fresh",
    "Overall I still think it needs to be improved before I would add it",
    "Pretty chill song - has some old school vibes",
    "The rapping was decent, but I think the flows were too slow",
    "The acapella choir chanting part I was not really feeling",
    "My closing advice would be to speed up the rapping a bit",
    "I liked listening to this song because I love this low energy type stuff",
    "For what it aims to be, this song is good imo but it still could be better",
    "The vocals could be better, the melodies you create are really nice though, and the lyrics are good",
    "The biggest room for improvement has to be the voice department",
    "I didnt really understand the outro, but other than that I think the rapping is great and the beat reminds me of that chill old school LA vibe",
    "The beat is a bit boring to me",
    "The singing is alright but I think it still has room for improvement",
    "I dont really like the 8-bit melodic element, I do like it in general, but in this song, I dont think its executed well at some parts, its too loud in my opinion",
    "The last verse was good",
    "you notice all energy is lost when it transitions to the (pre-)hook, so I think the (pre-)hook is not good enough",
    "The hook itself is better but also a bit repetitive",
    ", the song should have a more finished ending, right now it sounds too abrupt",
    "I dont think the melody goes hard in this song, so I think its hard to create a fire song on this beat",
    "I like the beat of this song, although I do think the bass was overly present, I think it hits harder if its less present",
    "Of the vocalist, I think the voice is not perfect yet",
    "I think the energy of the vocalist is too low in some parts",
    "The parts where you get more intense and rapper faster/louder it sounds better because the bass is always booming",
    "Overall I dont think its good enough because I honestly dont think the voice is good enough atm",
    "I think its a decent song and for the most part enjoyed listening to it",
    "I thought some of the lyrics were pretty funny, like kissing your cousin and you had some other funny lines as well",
    "I dont love the song mostly because the beat to me is just not good",
    "The melody way too simple and for that reason gets repetitive almost instantly",
    "I think there is room for improvement in the beat production",
    "A pretty good song",
    "Although I dont love the beat enough of this song",
    "The main melodic lead is too simple and choppy, I like the other subtle melodic elements that are in the song more",
    "Your voice is pretty good and so is your rapping",
    "All in all I dont think its good enough, mainly because of the beat, but definitely recognize a lot of potential here",
    "I enjoyed listening to it",
    "You have a nice voice, it sounded really good with the choir, and you have a lot of range",
    "I also thought the band was really great",
    "I love the drummer of this song",
    "The song is pretty good but not interesting enough for me",
    "It all sounded too familiar",
    ", the song is kinda the same throughout the whole song",
    "I would summarize the song as a good, but uninteresting, listen and a song I would forget too quickly",
    "you have a lot of potential and this sound pretty close to what hip hop is putting out these days so I thnk you are on the right track",
    "Just try to be more unqiue and creative",
    "The hook is repetitive to me",
    "The rapping was good, however, at some point, you started singing during the verse and I personally was not feeling that part",
    "I think for the rapper, your singing voice can still improve",
    "And for the hook, I think you can make a more interesting hook, during the second hook you did some background vocals which improved it a lot already compared to the first hook",
    "the voice you use during these vocals (your singing voice) does not sound great yet to me",
    "Nevertheless, I enjoyed listening to this song",
    "The vocalist has a nice voice",
    "The beat was just chill and not intrusive and really allowed the vocalist to display his sining",
    "Ngs like this make or break on the voice, and I do think there is still room for improvement in that department, although im not sure if you can really improve that much and it wasnt bad, just not great",
    "The female vocalist is a really good singer, really in the last chorus it shined, a lot of intensity",
    "I also really liked the lyrics of the song",
    "The rapping was pretty good",
    "The beat was too boring to me which is why the entire song, in the end, felt a bit too tame and uninteresting to me",
    "It was a fine listen, but not remarkable or something that sticks with me when I finish listening to it",
    ", try to be a bit more creative with the adlibs instead of just repeating the last word, for example in the chorus",
    "And also in the chorus, the flow you do gets repetitive",
    "I think the song is pretty good, the voices were good (espescially the hook i think you did well) and the rapping was good enough",
    "The melody was uninteresting to me, but not bad or anything",
    "The rapping was interesting",
    "Its a different style and I am not really feeling it but I respect the uniqueness and I do like that it is different",
    "the beat was kind of lacking in my opinion in the melodic department",
    "Perhaps thats part of this style",
    "A pretty cool and interesting song",
    "I thought the beat was very interesting and chill to listen too",
    "The voice effects on the monologues I found a bit odd",
    "I liked the beat switch in the end, I was hoping for another verse of the vocalist",
    "The vocalists voice is a bit different, but not bad, kinda interesting actually",
    "The beat is really good of this song, it really gets you in a vibe",
    "The singing needs to be better, your voice is not yet as good as other artists that are featured in these type of dancehall songs",
    "the structure of the song is good, its well-produced, you have a good melody, and you have a rapping verse in there (last verse is really good, good job)",
    "50 seconds to start the first verse is too long",
    "The rapper definitely had some bars, like the Pocahontas line, and the hook was also pretty good",
    "The voice doesnt sound like its mastered or mixed perfectly",
    "The beat is pretty good and the rapping was good too",
    "But yeah as I said already when you have such a long intro and you start with the chorus that doesnt make sense to me",
    "The beat is wavy though and the rapper is definitely good so imma add it to my Wavy hip hop playlist",
    "I like the beat, it sounds uplifting",
    ", I dont think the voice is good enough, espescially the flaws are noticable during the singing in the chorus",
    "Otherwise (i",
    "Melodically) the chorus is pretty catchy, so good job on that",
    "Thats why I dont think the song is good enough",
    "Kinda has some Travis vibes",
    "Good hook, good melody during the hook and like the second voice during the hook",
    "And in general i think you have an interesting voice",
    "Its a good chill song with an interesting beat switch up",
    "For the review, I like the beat its kinda trancey and very easy too listen too, the vocalist has a nice voice for this type of track",
    "its its enjoyable listen",
    "I think the voice is not on the level it needs to be yet",
    "I do like how you made hook and the melody you used in your singing",
    "the singing itself doesnt sound professional enough yet",
    "The beat of the song is nice, nothing too comment on that ",
    "The style of this song doesnt mesh well with any of my playlists",
    "As far as reviewing, I think you have a good delivery of your lines, your flows you could be more creative and suprising with",
    "Your voice is pretty nice, you have good range and can handle both low and high notes",
    "The song is a bit too slow and RnBey for my hip hop playlists",
    "The hook is nice and catchy, but a bit simple and repeateed a lot in the song which is why it may get old pretty fast during the song",
    "The beat was nice, but the melody in the prechorus are too prominent, wish that was more subtle like during the verse and chorus or use a different preset for the melodocal element",
    "The song goes pretty hard",
    "Nice deep bass",
    "The rapping was good though",
    "Pretty cool song, really like the accent",
    "The song is a bit boring at the start because the beat is quite simple and the first verse is kinda tame",
    "the rapping was really good, espescially the second verse",
    "Loved the start and the energy of the second verse",
    "As a rapper you have a lot of potential",
    "The rapping goes pretty hard, you bring a lot of energy in the track and you have a good delivery of your lines",
    "Personally I dont really like the beat too much, particularly the low brass sound that hits on every note",
    "The style is different from my hip hop playlists, the flow is a bit like the traditional hip hop style and the beat as well",
    "The song is pretty decent",
    "I like the deep bass and the trancey melody",
    "I think the voice should still be better",
    "Similar songs like this often have really good singers and I feel this is not as good as them, yet",
    "the song in general I think is good, well-produced and well-written",
    "a lot of potential but not good enough yet",
    "Its a solid song but its just a bit too soft and unoriginal",
    "The melody is limited and sounds somewhat cliche",
    "The voices dont sound that good, something that still can improve",
    "And the hook is a bit boring, a bit too simple",
    "On the bright side, the song sounds close to professional production, like radio-ready, and everything is planned well in the song, formulaic - which is also kind of the problem",
    "There is a lot of potential",
    "I just feel this song lacks uniqueness and creativity and that I have heard this song hundreds of times before (not literally)",
    "Hope some of that was helpful - and this is just my opinion - so dont take it too serious",
    "Its a chill rap song, I think the vocalist has a nice voice and the beat is pretty chill as well",
    "Its a chill rap song, I think the vocalist has a nice voice and the beat is pretty chill as well",
    "A nice melancholic melody with some motivating rap over it",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough, especially during the high notes",
    "Other than that the song is pretty good",
    "obviously the voice is a major part of the song so if I dont like that I cant really love the song",
    "I think its a chill song, you have a good voice, and the beat has a nice vibe",
    "I think the song is cool, it has some interesting, slow, mystic melodies and you have a nice voice with a lot of range, I really liked when the voice started playing simultaneously near the end",
    "This song is a different style from the music I typically listen to, so I find it hard to review, but I can say I enjoyed listening to it",
    "The singing is pretty good",
    "The hook I feel could have been more creative and better",
    "The whole song sounds on one tempo, on one flow, this makes the listener lose some interest because it starts to sound monotonous/repetitive",
    "Its a good sound, it sounds well mixed and mastered, but I think I would need some more variation throughout the song",
    "Good song",
    "A unique voice, love the melody and rhythm of the song (I cant tell if this is original because it sounds very familiar)",
    "Thank you for the song chief!	",
    "The hook is great but play more with your voice in the hooks, it sounds a bit monotonous and safe during the hook",
    "The parts with just the sample playing, I really disliked those so really unfortunate those parts are in this song I otherwise love",
    "The verses are great, espescially the last one, loved the beat that was plaling during this verse as well",
    "This song could be much better with certain parts cut out, and other parts being more like that last verse",
    "Regardless",
    "A pretty chill dancehall vibe, a bit cheesy, but thats almost inevitable with love songs The voice is pretty good, still room for improvement, but an impressive range",
    "The singers melodies are great, chorus is very catchy",
    "The beat is simple and just really good",
    "Really nice track, you have a great voice with a lot of range (pitch wise)",
    "The song had a kind of hypnotic trancey vibe",
    "Good hook as well, pretty catchy",
    "The biggest room for improvement is the voice",
    "I think the singing needs improvement, but also the rap, the rapping voice sounds a lot different from the singing voice",
    "Personally I like the singing voice more",
    "The melodies you created throughout the song, such as in the chorus, were good",
    "when the rap starts right after the chorus you notice how the rapping voice is very different and it sounds pretty bad",
    "I think the verses suffer from the voice right now",
    ", the beat is good",
    "Overall I dont think the song is good enough, the vocalist needs to improve his voice, most notably during the verses",
    "I find the beat a bit boring/repetitive",
    "The rapping is alright but not enough to make the song interesting enough",
    "The last verse was my favorite, it had interesting flows and it switched up the flow and broke the monotonicity of the song",
    "the hook is not good enough and the beat is not good enough and its especially evident when the hook followed up that last verse",
    "I think the hook you made was pretty good",
    "The beat is also good",
    "Your verse, on the other hand, I didnt really like when you did the weird voice (first half of the verse)",
    "And I didnt like the voice of the last verse and I also had trouble understanding him",
    "Overall I dont feel the song is good enough because the verses did not sound good enough to me",
    "Interesting sound, it has a nice bounce and the rap sounds pretty good on it",
    "The voice of the hook is a bit too low IMO",
    "Pretty good song, I think there still is some room for improvement for the vocalist since it doesnt sound perfect yet too me, the voice is a bit high",
    "The song also could also use some more variation, it kind of stays the same the whole time throughout the song, mostly because the beat doesnt change much between verses and choruses, but also the flow can be switched up more by the rapper",
    "I dont think the song is good enough",
    "The melodic lead is kinda annoying, and the rest of the beat also doesnt sound too good",
    "The hook is twice too long, especially since its a pretty empty hook",
    "The rapping is alright, but the beat is just not good enough to really make the rap hit hard",
    "I didnt really understand the long sample of talking in the middle of the song",
    "I dont think the voice sounds good enough, I cant describe how, but is sounds a bit too high pitched I think but it also has anoter component about it I dislike that i cant quite describe",
    "The rapping was decent otherwise",
    "The hook was decent as well",
    "the way the voice sounds on faaacts (at the end) I just dont think it sounds good yet",
    "A really chill track with a nice bounce",
    "You have a good voice with a lot of range, your high notes sounded really good",
    "I like how the song has parts where its calm and parts where its more chill it offers enough variation",
    "The song is a pretty good listen, I like the melodies and rhythm you used throughout the song",
    "The voice, however, still has a lot of room to improve",
    "Espescially the second half of the chorus (the yeah yeah yeah) is fully dependent on the voice and it doesnt sound that good currently",
    ", the adlibs need to improve",
    "Other than those two points the song is solid, the rapping in the verses was good too",
    "I dont think its yet good enough though, but with a better voice i see a lot of potential",
    "Its a solid song but its not interesting enough",
    "The second voice during the chorus does not sound good to me btw",
    "about the song, it just kinda stays in the same flow, the melodic lead is not interesting to me",
    "You do have a good voice for this, the verses were really solid",
    "I think you have talent and potential",
    "this beat is kinda wack, especially that melodic lead is just tiring and uninteresting, the kicks, and drums are fine, but that melody has a boring rhythm, is incredibly simple, and stays the same so it gets repetitive",
    "In the chorus I dislike the beginning where it goes I learn that in life",
    ", but I like the part where it goes nobody nobody no",
    "The verses are both pretty good, I really like when you increase the intensity in both verses and your voice sounds good when it sounds like you yelling",
    "The ending could have been better, it sounded like the song ended while it still wasnt finished",
    "Overall I think you made a pretty good song, I do think your voice is a bit high an together with the theme and lyrics it makes the song sound a bit soft and too young, but if its aimed at highschoolers I guess the song is really good",
    "I think the singing/rapping was good, I especially like the last verse and first verse",
    "For the rapping in the middle, its good, but I think the voice is kinda mediocre",
    "For the beat, tHe melodical elements sound weird to me and put me off, I do like the melody they follow, its just the presets/instruments used for them sound weird",
    "Pretty good song, you manage to bring a lot of energy in the track",
    "the rapping is good, but I dont really like the beat enough to really love this song, specifically the main melody (the loop) is not interesting to me and gets repetitive to fast, so i dont think this song is good enough",
    "I think the singing/rapping was good, I especially like the last verse and first verse",
    "For the rapping in the middle, its good, but I think the voice is kinda mediocre",
    "For the beat, tHe melodical elements sound weird to me and put me off, I do like the melody they follow, its just the presets/instruments used for them sound weird",
    "Pretty good song, you manage to bring a lot of energy in the track",
    "the rapping is good, but I dont really like the beat enough to really love this song, specifically the main melody (the loop) is not interesting to me and gets repetitive to fast, so i dont think this song is good enough",
    "The rapping is pretty good, you bring a lot of energy in the track",
    "I think the voice still has room for improvement, its not great to listen too right now",
    "The hook is pretty good as well, its catchy, but again I feel like if the voice was better it would be a better listening experience",
    "Overall I dont think the song is good enough",
    "The song has a good beat, I like the melodic elements used in the song to create a really vibrant and upbeat song",
    "For the vocalist, there still is some room for improvement",
    "At the moment the voice does not sound good enough, it sounds too autotune and most of the words are pronounced overly exaggerated, though that might just be the accent",
    "Overall I dont think the song is good enough yet and the artist can still improve his vocal abilities",
    "The hook is not exciting enough and sounds too monotonous",
    "The verses are a lot better but still sounds a bit empty as well",
    "the biggest problem with the song is definitely the hook and you should try to make the rap more interesting, like use more inflections, different flows, faster flows, etc",
    "Espescially since the beat is pretty static",
    "The song is too dry right now",
    "I like the vibes of this song",
    "The song is a bit predictable though like it lacks originality",
    "The rapping/singing is pretty good but its not on the level it needs to be yet especially when you deal with such a high pitch",
    "I think its a good song but I dont really think it improves my playlist atm",
    "I think the song is pretty good, the hook is simple maybe a bit too simple, but the verses are good, both of them",
    "The beat is decent, nothing too special, a pretty short loop and it doesnt change much throughout the song",
    "I like the beat, love those melodic elements",
    "The rap is good too, both of you go hard and have cool flows",
    "The voice/singing is not good enough, dont know how else to put it",
    "The rest of the song is pretty good, decent beat, decent hook",
    "You went hard the whole song",
    "The song/beat does kinda stay the same so variation could be a bit better, and the hook could be a bit better",
    "the rapping was great, really fire",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough",
    "The beat isnt good enough either, its too minimal, it got a little better when it dropped (drums&percussion kick in) but still not good enough, the main melodic element is just uninspired",
    "Overall this song is not good enough",
    "The song creates a really chill vibe and mood",
    "I can see myself listening to this on a study playlist or something",
    "On my playlists, unfortunately, I dont feature instrumental tracks, they would feel out of place",
    "Not feeling the beat on this song, the beat sounds messy to me, ease on the percussion, for the bass let it breathe, put some space between the bass",
    "The rapping was decent enough, but overall I dont think the song is good enough",
    "The rapping is good, you have a lot of interesting flows throughout the song and bring a lot of energy and you experiment with your voice",
    "The beat I am not feeling at all, the main melodic lead is just boring",
    "The hook is good, simple and catchy",
    "Nice voices, both of you",
    "Good hook",
    "One critic: The cussing sample kinda took me out of the trance and vibe of the song",
    "Nevertheless, its a great RnB song because you have a nice vibey trancey beat and you have good vocalists",
    "I dont think the vocalist is good enough, his voice still has room for improvement to make it more pleasant to listen too, the voice also isnt mixed perfectly imo",
    "Other than that, the song has a nice bounce and overall I think its a solid effort, but not good enough yet",
    "Interesting song, I kinda like the beat with how the bass is very prominent",
    "The voice Im not sure if its good enough yet, I feel like there is still room for improvement there",
    "The rapping is pretty good, you bring a lot of energy in the track",
    "The beat I am not really feeling too much to be honest",
    "The chorus I also was not loving",
    "Youre singing is fine, but I dont like singing in hip hop songs personally",
    "The melody is a bit predictable",
    "The singing is alright, but the voice doesnt sound great at all times, either its the voice is not good enough or the effects that are working on it arent great",
    "I think this style of music is interesting, but the song is too slow for my hip hop playlists",
    "I felt like the voice at some parts was sounding a bit too extra if that makes sense, like too exaggerated",
    "Other than that, I think you made a pretty cool song, with a cool hook, a song you could probably invent a dance for",
    "Its a fun song",
    "the song was fun too listen too, from the intro to the impressive rapping in the verses",
    "You have a nice flow and your lines hit hard, and you are rapping on a good beat as well",
    "A chill song, I enjoyed the listen",
    "Both the singing and rapping is pretty good, you have a nice voice",
    "The melody is a bit predictable",
    "The singing is alright, but the voice doesnt sound great at all times, either its the voice is not good enough or the effects that are working on it arent great",
    "I think this style of music is interesting, but the song is too slow for my hip hop playlists",
    "The song is a really chill vibe",
    "I love the bas0 and the deep kicks and the soft melody",
    "The singing is pretty good, you have a pretty unique voice and a lot of range in terms of pitch",
    "The voice is too high pitched for my playlist so it sounds from a kid",
    "Which I think is really cool that you are already rapping and stuff, do your thing",
    "in my playlist it would be out of place since the music is more aimed towards a mature audience",
    "To be far, your rapping is pretty good, you have a lot of potential, but atm your voice stills sounds too juvenile",
    "The hook and verses you made was actually pretty good",
    "You have a really nice voice, a little bit reminiscent of Ariana",
    "The beat is nice as well, has a nice little bounce",
    "The hook is OK, dont really fw the lyrics, the oompa loompa sounds a bit goofy to me - but the melody and bounce during the chorus is great",
    "The verses were good as well",
    "I liked the song, I dont have a playlist for it though because its not hip-hop enough (i do hear some hip-hop influences, such as the beat) but its more pop",
    "The rapping is not good enough, the voice isnt either it is too monotonous and in general just sounds amateurish, the flows at some part were good",
    "The beat isnt good enough either, the melody is minimal and again it just sounds a bit amateurish and boring",
    "I dont like the song, I am sorry for the honesty, but I think you still have a lot of room for improvement",
    "Its a nice song, a good melody, the beat is chill to vibe too",
    "The vocalist has a nice voice",
    "I like the hook the most, but the verses are fine as well",
    "That tiny melodic little riff that goes through the middle of the bar does not always sound great though, especially during the verse, it kind of interrupts the vocals",
    "thats just a small thing",
    "Really great hook",
    "Love the song, I like the theme, the lyrics, the hook, the instrumental and of course I think the voice is great as well",
    "My playlists are too hip hop for this though, this is too pop",
    "Great stuff though, keep it up, I also enjoyed your previous songs",
    "I actually like the entire EP",
    "You are as good as all these mainstream pop artists like Jessie Reyez Kehlani etc",
    "Chill beat and a nice voice to listen too",
    "Thank you!	1",
    "Its a pleasant song to listen too",
    "The voices are all nice and overall it has a soothing effect",
    "The melody is happy and makes you feel good",
    "The song is pretty good, offers a lot of variation with combining singing and rapping and the beat is also well produced",
    "About the artist, I think his voice can still improve at some parts to be honest, especially during the rapping I think it didnt sound good enough",
    "I do respect the creativity and uniqueness of this song",
    "There is not a particular thing bad about this song but I dont think its good enough, its a pretty solid effort though",
    "The vocalist does not have a great voice and the verses or hook did not impress me",
    "I dislike the voice changer used in the hook, it doesnt match with the beat imo",
    "The beat is the thing i like by far the most about the song, but also this lacks a little bit of variation",
    "Its a bit too slow/pop for my hip-hop playlists",
    "The singing is good, it reminded me of MJ",
    "The beat is nice too, it really builds up (and down) and offers enough variation to stay interested",
    "I am not really feeling this song",
    "The bass is kinda weird how it has that slides effect, I think it would have been better if it was just a simple bass that hits with spaces between instead of gliding between notes",
    "The rapping is pretty good and brings a lot of energy",
    "The hook is fun as well, the singing is good",
    "The ending is too abrupt, could have been improved to have a more subtle ending",
    "Overall I dont think the song is good enough, mainly due to the bass",
    "The rapping is great",
    "The beat I was not feeling",
    "I feel like the rapping and the beat also dont really match",
    "Like I think your rapping would work way better on a beat that goes harder with a less vague melody",
    "This beat doesnt really have a melody to bounce your head too",
    "This song I dont really like but I recognize you have a lot of potential since the rapping really impressed me",
    "Its not good enough",
    "The flows are alright and the beat is too",
    "The voice is not good enough during the rap and especially not during singing parts",
    "The rapping is good I like the delivery of the lines and you manage to bring intensity and energy with the track",
    ", I do find the song a bit boring, either because its not my style or because the song does not offer enough variation throughout the song, for example, you could switch the flows or tempo up a bit more and the beat can also switch up more, or maybe have a hook, right now it was just one verse that sounded too much alike throughout the whole song",
    "Its a solid song and you did go hard, but its not good enough for the playlist I had in mind",
    "Its a solid song, with a positive message",
    "The beat is upbeat and energizing while the lyrics are motivating and inspiring",
    "The rapping is of good quality as well",
    "To be honest, I am not feeling this song",
    "The rapping is alright (not great) but its mostly the beat that is not interesting to me",

    "The rapping is alright (not great) but its mostly the beat that is not interesting to me",
    "Rry for the bluntness, but I dont think the voice is good enough",
    "The beat also is a bit boring",
    "I think the biggest focus should be improving the voice",
    "Finding a different beat shouldnt be hard",
    "The music is good, the beat keeps you in a nice bounce and overall the song produces a real vibe, all the artists on this track sound good the rappers as well as the female singer",
    "I enjoyed listening to the song",
    "The beat was slow and soothing and you have a nice voice to listen too",
    "The song has a nice vibe",
    "It utilizes kicks well and the bassline is good as well",
    "I initially liked the voice, i",
    "During the verse, but during the chorus, I thought it was less good",
    "The chorus has good production though, with all the sound effects in the background, but I find the vocalist just not good enough during the chorus, sorry",
    ", the word dark angel just gets mentioned wayyy too much throughout the song that it started bothering me at some point",
    ", I think the climax is just not great - but that makes sense since Im not loving the vocalist during the chorus",
    "Rry for not loving this current song, could also just be my personal taste, of course.	1",
    "It was a chill song to listen too",
    "You have a nice voice with a lot of range and the beat was a vibe",
    "I liked the rapping, but sometimes the flows were repeated too much so it sounded a bit bland or empty",
    ", the hook I didnt find too interesting",
    "I enjoyed the soft piano melody, I think the rapping was pretty good as well, but overall the song stays a bit too tame/bland because the melody is repetitive and the rapping doesnt bring much variation throughout the track and neither does the beat",
    "Overall its a solid and listenable song but not really any addition to any of my playlists",
    "Great song",
    "Chill vibe, great instrumental, the rapping/singing is good",
    "Just a very solid song",
    "like the theme/message and the sample in the song",
    "Imma add this to my Laid back vibes playlist, thank you!	1",
    "Great melodies in the song",
    "The singing is okay, and the song reminds me of a bit of JuiceWRLD style, but the singing is not yet on his level",
    "I really like the melodies used in this song, by the beat, and by the singing in the hook, its very catchy, and the beat sounds good as well",
    "About the song, the rapping was pretty good and I also like the beat, it had a nice deep bass",
    "I personally didnt like the chorus though",
    "I like the beat, it has a nice melody",
    "The rapping is pretty good as well (you could try more variation in your flows though) and the hook was good too",
    "I dont like the voice enough, I feel there is still room for improvement in that area, the flaws espescially becomes noticable in the chorus",
    "Maybe more autotune or voice training idk",
    "The singing/voice is decent, but it doesnt blend well",
    "The prechorus of you singing You still at the party sounds really good",
    "For the instrumental hook that follows, personally, I dont like the raspy melodic element that is used there",
    "The bridge at the end was cool",
    "Its a pretty good song, I just dont love that raspy instrumental chorus and I feel like the voice also has room for improvement",
    "The whole song is at the same pace/tempo there are no (or too few) speed-ups or sudden flow switches or anything to break the monotonicity of the song",
    "It ends up sounding like a solid (but uninteresting) song that struggled to keep me interested as it became old fast",
    "Especially since the hook wasnt that interesting either",
    "good effort but I think its not good enough yet",
    "The song was alright but never really took off",
    "I think the beat is nice and allows for reflective rapping and is nice to listen too, but the rapping itself still has a lot of room to improve one thing is that the voice sounds too monotonous and it makes the verses somewhat lifeless",
    "I think its a solid effort but not good enough",
    "Its a solid song but it lacks something interesting, I think the beat is just a bit too boring",
    "You have a good voice, you are both skilled at the singing and rapping",
    "The hook is also to me not interesting at all, its just too simple the same melody keeps getting repeated every line",
    "You definitely have potential but this song is not making me excited enough",
    "I thought the verses were good, you clearly now how to rap",
    "The hook however I think is boring, this song could really have used a more interesting hook espscially since the beat/melody is a short repetitive loop",
    "I think its a decent song but not good enough",
    "I see what you try to do here, i hear a lot of influence from playboi carti, but I am not feeling the voice so as a result I dont really like the song",
    "The rapping is pretty good",
    "The beat is too weird for me to really vibe too",
    "I respect you trying something different incorporating classical music in your beat, but I think it distracts too much from the rapping",
    "A nice slow song, works really calming",
    "You have a nice voice, and your high notes are really good",
    "Nothing wrong with the rapping",
    "The beat is just way too tame though, it doesnt really excite me or keep me interested in the song long enough",
    "I like the song it was nice to listen too",
    "The song has a sweet melody and the singing was nice and I liked the second voice",
    "Once the beat kicked in the song was something that I could see in my playlist, unfortunately that doesnt happen until like 1-2 minutes into the song",
    "I like the beat, its light and wavy and melodic - but I think it is ok to change it up more throughout the song so it does not get repetitive",
    "The rapping - and also the hook - I am not feeling too much, I feel it lacks variation espescially in the flow, so this also ends up getting repetitive",
    "The voice doesnt really sound good to me, also the second voice doesnt sound good",
    "The rapping is alright but I dont love that either",
    "The melody is minimal",
    "The weird yelling at the end I didnt fee either",
    "I think this song is a bit too juvenile for any of my playlists",
    "I think the melody is pretty good but it does stay kind of the same throughout the song",
    "The singing I really liked as well as the accents",
    "I dont think I have a playlist for this song",
    "The song stays a bit too tame and should try to be a bit more exciting and have more variation",
    "Good effort, and keep it up!	1",
    "Not really loving the voice in all parts",
    "I usually like when the singer kind of screams (not literally) but like stretches a syllable, like juicewrld also does, but I think the voice during these parts are not yet good enough",
    "I think there is potential but the voice needs to improve for this song to really be where it needs to be",
    "Ng is a bit too slow for any of my playlists",
    "The singing is pretty good and so is the beat, but I do think the song lacks something",
    "It can use a bit more variation throughout the song because I did feel myself getting a bit bored",
    "The rapping is alright and so is the beat, I would rate it with a 6",
    "My playlists only feature english music so this would be out of my place in my playlists",
    "I am not really feeling the voice on this track",
    ", the speech is a bit too slurred so its hard to understand",
    "Besides that, I do like the melodies you created both the instrumental but also the singing in the hook, its a catchy melody",
    "You also had some nice flows during the song",
    "Its a fun song to listen to I have to pass on it because I dont think the voice sounds good enough, but other than that its a pretty good effort!	1",
    "Honestly, I am not feeling this song",
    "The theme and the lyrics of the chorus and most of the verses just sound uncool to me",
    "The whole song sounds kinda fake, unauthentic, acted to me",
    "Espescially the singing hook sounds so poppy that it just takes the whole hip-hop out of the song",
    "Me parts of the verses went hard though, I liked the beginning of the second verse for instance",
    "Really cool beat but it offers very little variation",
    "The rap needs to provide more variation when the beat is such a short loop and gets repeated so much",
    "I think its a decent song but it wasnt interesting enough to me",
    "I think with this beat and some more creativity (in the flows for example) the song could have been great",
    "Ng is a bit monotonous, actually I mean the voice is",
    "Espescially in the hook the melody just gets tiring because the singing is not good enough",
    "The second voice however is a lot more interesting and fun too listen too",
    "because the first voice is more throughout the song the majority of the song I am not really feeling unfortunately",
    "Cool song, really chill and soothing and brings you in a trance",
    "Singing is very nice",
    "I loved the percussion, the bass and all the sound effects in the background",
    "I think its a good and very listenable song when you want to wind down and lose your thoughts or want to daydream",
    "Good job!!	",
    "I think the beat is pretty chill although the bass did sound a bit too distorted? or some other quality that I didnt like, but also the bass sounded too irregular throughout the track as if it were inserted at random moments",
    "The singing of both vocalists is good",
    "The hook I am not really feeling, the rhythm and melody of the singing in the hook sounds too easy which makes it uninteresting",
    "Both artists sound really talented espescially the female has a really nice voice",
    "I cant always hear what is said so I wish it was a bit clearer and bit less mumbly, for example to my ears ths song should be called cherry pie and not sunday",
    "Ng is interesting though, offers enough variation throughout the song, the hook is pretty nice and melodic and energetic and I also like how the artist really uses his voice in all ways, he has no problem going really high but I dont think it always sounds great so theres still room for improvement of the voice",
    "Even though the beat is melodic, which I like, I think it still sounds amateurish, like the melodical tracks of the instrumental dont really blend well at all",
    "I dont really like the song tbh",
    "The same flow is used a lot throughout the song and I dont find the flows used interesting",
    "The beat doesnt offer much variation either and lacks melody as well",
    "the song sounds too empty in the end",
    "I dont like the hook either, but for no specific reason",
    "I did like the writing (the lyrics)",
    "I dont think the rapping, or actually the voice is good enough",
    "I thought the rapping and the hook was interesting and definitely showed skill and creativity, but I am not feeling the voice espescially during the rapping",
    "I think there is still plenty of room for improvement",
    "the regular beat during the verses is kinda boring",
    "yeah, pretty cool and creative stuff though but I think most of my followers arent trying to hear it when they want listen to my hip hop playlist",
    "Its an interesting song though, I like the beat and rythm",
    "I think the singing still has room for improvement if im honest",
    "Best thing I liked were the melodies and just the pelasant vibe the song created",
    "Ng was pretty cool, hard flows and fun lyrics too listen too",
    "Ad libs sounded too distorted",
    "Unfortunately I dont have a playlist for this song, its too energetic for my laidback hip hop playlists",
    "A pretty chill beat",
    "I think the singing in the hook worked out well",
    "I think the rapper is not good enough yet, I dont really like most of the lyrics and his flow is not impressing me",
    "I thought it was a pretty good song but wish it had a more interesting hook and a more interesting beat as well",
    "The beat is fun although it is kinda repetitive since it doesnt vary at all throughout the song",
    "I was not really feeling the flow in the first half of the verse, too much space left in the track, it got better though",
    ", the hook I felt you could have done much more for, to me it is not interesting enough right now",
    "I definitely think you have the talent but this song is not good enough for me",
    "The beat is too repetitive and doesnt change much at all during the song, it sounds the same during the verse and the hook",
    "The hook is also another let down of the song, its also way too repetitive and just lacks creativity",
    "The verses were a lot better",
    "All together I dont think the song is good enough though",
    "Its a nice positive song, the singer has a nice voice and the beat is pretty chill, a real vibe",
    "Its not bad by any means but I much prefer the original",
    "I think the singing is not as good and I prefer the original beat of Marvins Room as well",
    "I have to skip this one",
    "I enjoyed the verses, I think the rapping is good, good flows, fun adlibs, good writing",
    "The hook feels bland to me",
    "I am not really feeling the voice of the vocalist, espescailly that haa sound during the hook",
    "I think its a decent song but not good enough",
    "Im not feeling the voice on this track, espescially when you are more singing than rapping, like when you sing baby im a fly it does not sound good",
    "The rapping was a lot better, good flows and good writing, it head my head bopping up and down during the first verse",
    "The hook is a recurring part of the song and I am not feeling it so I cant say i love this song enough to add it",
    "The rapping is good but Im not really feeling the voice of the vocalist",
    "The hook I think could have been better its a bit too simple and bland",
    "The beat is a very short loop so it gets kind of repetitive",
    "I dont like it enough to add",
    "It just needs a more creative beat and maybe your voice can get a bit lower or something.	",
    "Singing is very nice and the accent as well",
    "The flow in the chorus (and the first verse) sounds too choppy to me and the chorus is a big part of the song so unfortunately I dont fw most of the song",
    "I thought the verses were really good",
    "The song has a nice bounce to it and creates a nice vibe",
    "The singer is pretty good and nice to listen too, though, his voice is a bit high for my liking",
    "The chorus is energetic",
    "The song is too basic to me and has too much of a juvenile feel, the artists name also doesnt battle that",
    "The voice is ok, not great",
    "The lyrics at some points just were not good, im doing so good, youre doing okay, so please",
    "That whole line is just bad and I felt a lot of the other lyrics also just showed bad/lazy writing",
    "The chorus is good, has a nice vibe and energy, so good job on that",
    "I do think there is a lot of potential but Im not really feeling this song",
    "I do think you made a pretty good song, there definitely is a vibe going on",
    "I also think the voice still has some room for improvement, I wasnt always feeling the singing",
    "Really chill vibe",
    "Love the soothing choir in the background in the intro",
    "You have a nice voice to listen too which is very important for a calm down song like this",
    "I dont have a playlist for this style of music, its too far from hip hop",
    "great effort, and keep it up!	",
    "The song was pretty good",
    "The singing is alright but not great",
    "I did like the chorus and drop",
    "I think the verses were a lot weaker, mainly because I am not impressed by the vocalist",
    "the voice effects during the prechorus are a bit weird imo",
    "Hope some of this feedback is useful!	",
    "I thought the verses were fun to listen too, especially the second verse was hot from the start",
    "The hook is fine as well",
    "Its a good song, keep it up",
    "My hip hop playlists more melody focused instead of lyrics, so this would kinda stop the vibe",
    "I like it, the song has a unique interesting feel to it",
    "The beat reminds me of the old Eminem while the rapping is more of the modern style of rap these days",
    "The lyrics were fun",
    "Only thing I didnt like was the (weird voice in the) intro and the super long outro",
    "Keep it up though!	",
    "I think the song is pretty good but I feel like the voice still has a lot of room to improve",
    "Right now its just lacked energy and also it just doesnt sound great, for example the high notes",
    "Me parts of the song let me down, the parts where there suddenly was no singing any more but just noises (right after the amazing chorus)",
    "I do think the song is pretty nice but I think the drums are too much, wish they were more chill, and some parts of the song the vocalist let me down even though I like his voice, the rapping for instance sounded too way too flat, as if he was just talking",
    "The singing in the chorus is amazing, thats my favoirte part",
    "the post chorus with just noises I think is less good",
    "I wasnt impressed by the singing",
    "I cant really review this type of music because I am unfamiliar with it",
    "All I know is I was not loving the voice, so perhaps you can improve that",
    "Hey, I think its a pretty good song",
    "Loved dababys verse",
    "I dont really like Lil babys voice though, like his voice annoys me to be honest so I cant really listen to it or add it to my playlist",
    "The song was kind of stuck in the same choppy flow and the pace was too slow for any of my playlists",
    "I definitely hear a lot of potential though! Keep it up!	",
    "I think you made a catchy hook, a suave instrumental, and the rapping is good",
    "The second verse I think the voice was a bit too extra",
    "again a lot of potential I hear in these songs",
    "Great song with a lot of energy with a very anthemic sound and I love the use of multiple artists on a track",
    ", I dont really have playlist for this style of music! Keep it up!	",
    "Pretty chill beat",
    "I could see myself listening to something like this when I need to focus or study",
    "The drum was rythmic and have put me in a nice groove while the sounds were more trancey",
    "great song to calm down too and empty your mind",
    "I dont have any instrumentals on my playlists though, unfortunately",
    "Anyways, keep it up!	",
    "The song is a bit too simple/generic to me, from the melody to the flow",
    "I definitely think you have some potential, but maybe try more your own unique style and be creative because I feel like I have heard this exact song too many times already",
    ", dont misunderstand, its not a bad song, just not new/unique enough for me.	",
    "I think the hook could be (a lot) better, it just lacks something and it feels a bit empty, espescially since you repeat it twice each time, it should be better",
    "The rapping is pretty good, espescially in the second verse, the first verse was kinda weak",
    "The beat also could be improved, its a bit too tame and no variation throughout song",
    "Its a pretty good song but I think the voice still needs to improve when singing those high notes (like in the chorus)",
    "I am not really feeling the chorus, and the chorus forms a big part of this song like 50%",
    "Its definitely not bad and I think there is a lot of potential, but this song doesnt interest me enough",
    "The whole song sounds a bit dated like not up to date with current rap",
    "The hook is too uninspired and cliche to me",
    "The rapping is pretty good but pretty slow and the flows sound old to me",
    "Chill vibe, chill rap",
    "A more traditional style of rapping than most current rap",
    "Hook could have been better",
    "other than that, very solid song",
    "The song is good but I dont have a good playlist for this song atm",
    "it definitely has room for improvement, so what I mean is its a 6 out of 10, to me",
    "Its a pretty chill jazzy hip hop song, but it doesnt keep me interested for long enough while listening to it",
    "I guess it lacks something for me and is a bit too tame and ends up getting repetitive",
    "The rapper is definitely talented and has a lot of potential",
    "My honest opinion is that I dont think the rapping is that good and the singing is worse",
    "The beat Im not really feeling either, the beat sounds kinda juvenile with the melody and the bass is just not good",
    "The whole song sounds too juvenile to me",
    "I dont think the rapping in the first verse is good, it lacks energy and an interesting vibe",
    "I do like how the hooks and the verses sound alternative to normal hip hop",
    "My favorite part was the verse with the lyric turn the volume up, the other verses werent that good to me",
    "The rainbow eyes chorus is cool and creative but I dont think the voice is good enough",
    "Lovely upbeat vibe and just an energizing song",
    "Great for my Island playlist",
    "THANKS! keep it up	",
    "I dont think the rapping is good enough",
    "The flow stays very similar throughout the song and it gets kind of boring after a while",
    "The theme of the song doesnt interest me that much either, a bit too ordinary",
    "Im not really feeling the voice, it sounds to autotuney to me",
    ", it feels like the voice gets overshadowed to much by the beat making it hard to understand at some points, the hats are a bit on the loud side",
    "I think the rapping verse in the middle of the song was the best part",
    "Overall I dont like it enough to add",
    "Im not really into the singing to be honest",
    "I do think the hook you created is pretty funky and the beat overall is pretty funky",
    "A really chill song, you have a really nice voice",
    "I also like the hook you created",
    "The rapping is good and has a lot of energy you really brought intensity to the track",
    "Unfortunately as of now all my hip-hop playlists are focused around laidback vibes",
    "maybe next song I can add if its more chill!	",
    "Instantly the songs starts with a chill funky vibe",
    "The first vocie came in a bit to low volume and wasnt that impressive",
    "The rapping was good, it reminds me of the traditional style of rapping",
    "The chorus Im not really feeling, I guess the female voice doesnt impress me",
    "The beat also is nice but it gets repetitive, I wish there was more variation throughout the song",
    "I think its a good song but still room for improvement! Good lcuk!	",
    "I dont like the voice (at all) in this song",
    "The effect on it just sounds ridiculous to me",
    "the beat is kinda lame",
    "I cant add this to my playlist",
    "I really like the flow of the rapper, it really has the new hip hop sound that I like that all the new rappers sound like, like Lil keed, thugger etc",
    "Its a good sound",
    "Your voice is not on their level yet but I definitely hear a lot of potential",
    "Good hook as well",
    "I dont like the voice, it sounds to autotuney/robotic",
    "And the rapping is not that good",
    "Dope flows and writing",
    "Rapping (voice) still has room for improvement",
    "In my laidback hip hop playlist its mostly melodical vibes and this is more the diss/cypher type of track, so even though its laidback its not really a vibe",
    "Anyways, I liked the track, really like the lyrics",
    "I feel liek the voice can be mixed better on the song",
    "Right now it feels to on top of the instrumental iykwim, or maybe its just the voice itself that needs to improve",
    "Chill beat, good bass, cute melody",
    "Great chorus, love how that first sentence is acapella and it just hits nicely",
    "a catchy one",
    "Voice I think can still improve, but I do like how you took a lot of risk with all the high notes, and I loved them",
    "its a very chill and listenable song, maybe a bit too simple so it may get repetitive but I cant tell that yet, so well done Im sorry I cant add it!	",
    "Think its pretty good",
    "The rapping reminds me a bit of Eminem",
    "Beat is simple but suffices, it gets you in a nice trance and allows you to focus on the lyrics",
    "Nice track, really like the melodies throughout the song created by the instruments and the singer",
    "The violin and piano both sound really good",
    "I love how the tempo and intensity fluctuates throughout the song",
    "A good job",
    "Prety cool but I do not have a playlist for dubstep",
    "Been a long time since I listened to some dubstep, but I gotta say this one really was interesting to listen too",
    "good job",
    "Favorite part was in the middle, when it was calm and you had that soothing melody with the little crispy hats.  the drops were great too.	",
    "I think its a pretty good song, you made a nice chorus",
    "Overall this type of hip hop I dont really have a playlist for, this is more the traditional style of rapping instead of the new modern type of rap that I prefer",
    "the beat is not really my taste, it just sounds dated to me",
    "its not bad just not my style",
    "I really like the sound of this",
    "I like the minimalistic beat",
    "Rappers voice sounds kinda like Lil Baby, which is not my favorite sound, but its still good enough but I think he still has room to improve",
    "The melodies of the rapper are good, really like the melody he sings in the chorus",
    "I dont think the song is good enough",
    "I find the melody a bit repetitive and overall the song just doesnt keep my interest long enough, the beat stays the same throughout the whole song, the verse and the chorus",
    "The hook is pretty in my opinion",
    "The rapping I think still has a lot of room for improvement",
    "I think the verse would have been better if the beat differed a bit from the the beat in the chorus so the song has more variation throughout, because now any point in the song sound like any other point (espesciialy with that melody)",
    "The rapping is not good enough in my opinion, the flow, the way the voice is mixed on the track, the tone/pitch of the voice itself (monotonous and false)",
    "On a positive note, I do like the hook",
    "I also think the beat is not good enough, its too simple and it sounds like not made by a professional",
    "Rry for the bluntness but this is my honest opinion",
    "You have a nice voice",
    "The beat is a definite vibe",
    "Really chill and gets your head bopping during the song - Good use of drums",
    "The song is a bit too RnBey and not rap enough for my playlists, unfortunately",
    "I enjoyed listening to it, good song!	",
    "I like the beat but i wish the melody wasnt that simple, it gets a bit repetitive to just hit those notes every bar, i wish there were more (subtle) melodic elements in the song",

    "I dont love the hook, I though the verses without vans drip were better",

    "He raps well, I do think he should switch up the flows a bit more",
    "The ending was abrupt, I think a better ending to the song could have been made",
    "The producer tag at the start was too loud and didnt sound good",

    "The song definitely has a chill bounce",

    "Great accent (ATL",
    ") and its clear you have GREAT rapping skills",
    "The song gets a bit monotonous, and the piano is minimal so much of the whole track depends on the bass-line (which is excellent) but I think its not enough",
    "I wish there were some more melodical elements in the song, like during the hook, or just make the song a lot shorter",
    "The verses were REALLY good, the rapping, the lyrics",
    "The hook not so much",
    "I think this song would have worked better if it was shorter, considering the minimalistic beat",

    "Pretty chill beat, I would have preferred more melodic creativity though, playing two notes is a bit too simple and gets repetitive",
    "The verses are good, I like the 808s and percussion (the hi-hats), I feel like the hi-hats are not present enough throughout the song, only during some parts of the verses we hear them, and they give the energy this song desperately needs",
    "Too much of the song sounds empty because there is too much space left, there are too few elements",

    "Its a pretty chill song, but it doesnt really interest me too much",
    "Its kind of in the middle between old hip hop and the new hip hop, so it sounds a bit dated, this style of rap",
    "back to reviewing, as a rapper you sound very good",
    "Reminds me of some of Tribes music, especially with this jazzy beat, I definitely recognize some of the flow",

    "The song has a pretty chill vibe and beat",
    "The singing is good (and so are the adlibs in the background)",
    "The hook is simple but pretty chill and catchy",
    "I think the intro was a bit too long though",
    "Has a very interesting sound",
    "I like all the sound elements, the guitar espescially, and the drums are done well too",
    "Pretty good voice, but it sounds a bit weird for some reason, I think maybe it could have been mixed/mastered better or there is some weird autotune going on",
    "I think it would be better if it had a more prominent melodic element in there because it just feels empty and repetitive",
    "I also think the chorus is uninspired, I didnt like the chorus",
    "I did like the bridge or third verse - the gang gang part - but other than that I wasnt blown away",
    "I do think the rapper has skills so it is probably just this particular song that I dislike!	",

    "It doesnt change enough imo, and its not a interesting enough beat to be looped like that, but thats just me personally",
    "it just misses some good bass, the kicks are not enough imho",
    "I think both rappers did great though, really fresh flows",
    "the song is just not interesting enough for me to add, solid effort though!	",
    "I love the band, the DRUMMER (great job",
    ") and the guitarist are awesome",
    "The vocalist has an amazing voice as well",
    "I love the chorus, its really chill and the melody the vocalist sings is so reminiscent of another song but I just dont know what song exactly",

    "It would have been nice if there was either a feature, more beat switch-ups, or more flow switch-ups",
    "Especially the chorus is a bit uninteresting after the second time",
    "The sound does come really close to the songs you hear on the radio so the quality is really good",
    "It has a very professional sound",
    "I can definitely see you making it",
    "Just make it a bit more interesting",
    "Like your song Eddie Kane, which I think does a great job of feeling interesting especially love that feature in the middle of the song",

    "It sounds like a fun song from the very start but especially the chorus is great",
    "I love how multiple people start singing together",
    "It was easily the best part of the song",
    "During the other parts of the song, I feel like too little is going on",
    "The piano creates a light interesting happy vibe, but during these non-chorus parts its the only thing you hear and it gets repetitive fast",
    "I also really like the climactic ending",
    "I like the beat it has a nice eerie dark vibe going, its a bit simple though",
    "The chorus is great, especially the lyrics and delivery work well, and its catchy",
    "It reminds me a bit of MGK",
    "Though this rapper is good I dont like the voice",

    "The chorus is really good too, the drowning lyrics are catchy, and makes me wonder why that isnt the songs title",
    ", ultimately, I am passing on this song because of the voice",
    "Melody is simple but pretty good, it has a nice light happy vibe",
    "The rapping is pretty good too, all verses have fun and interesting lyrics",
    "You have a very nice voice, perfect for folk/acoustic type of songs",
    "I think the guitar sounds good too",
    "The song is simple but cute",
    "I do think one might end up losing interest along the way since it doesnt get very interesting",
    "Nonetheless, still a good, very listenable song",
    "I love the beat and melody",
    "Its calming and just has a nice energy",
    "Your voice is great as well",
    "Love how the beat switches up during the the chorus",
    "The chorus is simple, but I like it",
    "It starts off with a nice wavy vibe; Really nice bass line and the piano is great as well - really establishes a soothing vibe",
    "I think there is room for improvement for the singing, though",
    "I love the rapping during the 2nd verse",
    "Great delivery of the lines and his flow is fresh, good cadence",
    "The song progresses nicely towards a climactic ending",
    "All in all, its a really solid song",
    "I just find the singing underwhelming and for that reason pass on this song",
    "Interesting beat, very alternative sounding",
    "I think the voice is mastered/mixed a bit weird, but maybe thats done on purpose",
    "I respect the creativity and originality of the song, but I am not really feeling it a lot",
    "The song instantly sets a nice vibe and is complemented by calm energy brought by a pleasant voice",
    "It sounds very professional and radio-ready",
    "The chorus sounds good and I love the production during the chorus, I mean those sound effects",
    "The instrumental part with just the sound effects sounds good too",
    "The transition from verse to chorus and vice versa is smooth",
    "Now the critique; The guitar is a bit repetitive",
    "The song doesnt change too much over the course of the song which is a bit disappointing",
    "The sound is good, though",
    "I almost like this song enough to add to my playlist, but not quite enough",
    "I really like the beat of this song",
    "It has a nice soothing vibe",
    ", I have to pass on it though because I dont like the voice enough and I didnt care for most of the lyrics",
    "Production from the start sounds interesting",
    "I think the beat is pretty great and the melody is nice and interesting",
    "I dont think the voice is good enough, yet - especially in the chorus (or whenever you go shout-ey)",
    "there is room for improvement there",
    "You do keep it very interesting, with a fresh flow and good lyrics and fine delivery",
    ", I have to pass on this song because I feel like the vocals isnt good enough yet",
    "The production sounds good, fine bass-line and percussion",
    "Your voice sounds like it has a bit too many effects on it for my taste",
    "This song is definitely interesting and creative, it was unpredictable, especially the climactic drops gave a drastic change of pace and made it even more interesting",
    "The song has an interesting melody",
    "I dont love the voice of the rapper during the 1st and 3rd verse",
    "The flow of the first verse also doesnt change much and gets kind of boring",
    "The 2nd verse where it speeds up it gets more interesting",
    "The song has a very nice sound",
    "The beat sounds of professional quality and I especially like the deep bassline",
    "You got a very nice lazy type of voice that brings you, as the listener, in a nice trance",
    "And you have some range too, as proven in the end",
    "I did think it kind of ended abruptly there",
    "Anyways, its a very solid song",
    "The song is a bit too slow for my hip hop playlist, though",
    "The production sounds good, fine bass-line and percussion",
    "Your voice sounds like it has a bit too many effects on it for my taste",
    "This song is definitely interesting and creative, it was unpredictable, especially the climactic drops gave a drastic change of pace and made it even more interesting",
    "Regardless, this is how I would review the quality: Not feeling the vocalist on the chorus and first verse",
    "Furthermore, beat production needs work",
    "I was not impressed by the string/brass instrument",
    "Furthermore, melody needs more variation",
    "The piano melody loop is good, but cant stand on itself",
    "Yes, the string/brass tries to give more depth - but, as already said, I think the string/brass is done poorly",
    "Overall the melodies sound too simplistic and superficial",
    "Instead of everything working together and creating a well-blending sound, you hear each element very distinctively and it would be so easy to remake the beat",
    "The problem with recognizing each element/instrument in the beat so easily is that you recognize the loop faster and thus it starts to bore you, as a listener, faster",
    "It also makes it sound more amateurish",
    "On a positive note, the rapper in 2nd verse and 3rd sounds great",
    ", for how simple the melody is I would also recommend against making the song that long",
    "This was my first review on here and I am not sure how much honesty is appreciated, I hope I did not come across as rude",
    "The beat is nice, it has a nice dark energy and a pretty good bounce",
    "The rapper has a good flow and delivery and switches it up enough",
    "I dont like really like the chorus much",
    ", I feel like the voice does not blend perfectly with the beat",
    "Seems like a mixing/mastering problem - perhaps a bit too trebly? I dont think the song sounds professional enough, so I have to pass on it - but its pretty good",
    "I think you have a really nice voice and accent",
    "The song has a nice, positive energy and vibe and theres a nice buildup from beginning to end",
    "I like how the chorus speeds up in terms of energy and that the verse keeps on going with that energy using the kick, and the climactic choir-y ending seems a good way to end this song - though I do not really like the ad-libs during that portion",
    "To be honest, and this could just be a personal thing, but I am not a big fan of the rappers voice that is doing the first verses and the chorus",
    "His flow is pretty good though and he does keep it fresh and interesting",
    "the chorus is not great either",
    "The rapper on the 3rd verse has a better rapping voice",
    "I also feel the production could be a bit better - the mixing/mastering - I feel like the bass and kick could sound better",
    "I just dont like it quite enough to add to my playlist",
    "The song has a nice energy and vibe going, the flow of the rapper is good, but could use more variation",
    "can the string instrument, the melody as of right now sounds a bit repetitive",
    "The percussion and 808s are good though, the 808s are really well timed and sound good",
    "Its a pretty good song with a good sound, but just not really interesting enough",
    "I dont like it quite enough to add it to my playlist",
    "I think you manage to create a lot of good - positive - energy that really gets a vibe going",
    "I was bopping my head to the beat and definitely enjoying the song",
    "The chorus is nice and actually catchy too",
    "The transitions from chorus to verses are flawless and I enjoyed the bridge as well",
    "I like the beat and instruments used in the beat",
    "It has a nice vibe and plenty of energy to create some sense of hype",
    "The voice also brings a lot of energy in the track",
    "The rappers flow is good and so is his delivery",
    "It reminds me a bit of Logic",
    "The song is too energetic for my laidback playlist though so I cant add it",
    "This song has a nice beat, it definitely had my head bopping",
    "The melody and 808s work very nice together, and percussion is well-done as well, so there is a very solid foundation",
    "The rapper is good, as well, - however - not very interesting",
    "His lyrics hit hard, but the flow stays pretty much the same throughout the song",
    "Furthermore, I find the chorus pretty boring and uninspired",
    "Nice vibe, it instantly had my head bopping to the beat, it got a good bounce",
    "More variation throughout the song beat-wise wouldnt have been a bad decision, though",
    "Thankfully, the beat is well produced with good percussion and kicks so playing it throughout the whole song is OK",
    "The rapper has a good interesting flow and makes a good chorus, again not really much variation there, but the catchiness of the chorus is definitely there which is important as well",
    "I do I enjoy it, however",
    "The flow is nice but it does kind of stay the same the whole song",
    "You know, that MadeinTYO/XXX/Lil Pump flow",
    "Beat is pretty cool too",
    "right now, because the beat and the flow stays the same throughout the whole song (yeah the beat occasionally goes an octave higher, but stays pretty much the same) any point in the song sounds like any other point",
    "You go hard the whole song but then, because you go hard the whole time, it doesnt really sound hard no more if you know what I mean",
    "I guess I mean variation",
    "The song has a very nice energy and vibe",
    "From the very start, I was bopping my head to the beat",
    "I also like the voice of the vocalist",
    ", I think the chorus was well done - catchy and everything - and the transition to the chorus seemed flawless and smooth",
    "I dont really have too much to say - its a very solid song, but also one that doesnt take too many risks",
    "From the very start, it sounds pretty interesting and unconventional",
    "Lots of energy and I was bopping my head, for sure, it happened automatically",
    "You have an interesting voice which together with the beat creates a nice and somewhat crazy vibe and energy",
    "Im left feeling a bit unsure of how I feel about what I am hearing which is, because it sounds so unfamiliar - but thats a good thing",
    "Its a solid, well-executed, song",
    "The piano is nice, the bass hits hard, and the voice is good",
    "The chorus is well done, I really enjoy the lyrics during the chorus",
    "One thing though, I do wish there was a bit more variation throughout the whole song",
    "anyways, I still like it enough to add to my playlist for a while",
    "You should check it out to draw inspiration from",
    "Beat undeniably has a nice laidback vibe, but I find the song a bit boring",
    "If the vocalist was better (i",
    "More interesting - e",
    "More flow-variation) it may work with such a low-saturated beat, but I feel right now, both the rapper and the beat are not interesting enough",
    "Production is good though, percussion is good, the sound, in general, is good, but I just am not loving it",
    "Chorus is a bit boring as well",
    "In conclusion, its a good song as far as technicality goes, but it just doesnt really pique my interest - so I wont be adding this one",
    "Unds like a legit trap/club banger",
    "The whole beat sounds chill and I especially like the 808s used",
    "Lyrics are fine too and I like the adlibs in the background",
    "I think the biggest struggle this type of music faces is that its not really whats hot right now - club/trap bangers - at least not like they used to be in the past",
    "I think this is definitely one of the better club/trap-bangers I have heard",
    "The beat is nice, soothing and wavy and the bassline is nice and deep",
    "I personally dont love the voice although I do like his voice during the Swae Lee part - I mean the part where you go really high",
    "All in all, it does get you in a nice trance",
    "Though, the song kind off drags on at some point",
    "Luckily, at that point you added the part with the new rapper to swich it up - which I think was a great decision",
    "He has room for improvement though, I mean its pretty good, kinda reminiscent of J",
    "Cole - who would have killed that, so Id say he should check out J",
    "Cole even more and he would have killed it even more",
    "Specifically, J",
    "Cole on Pretty Little Fears by 6LACK",
    "thats just a recommendation you may dismiss that",
    ", pretty good song - nice vibes, but I dont like it quite enough to add it to my playlist",
    "First, about the beat, I dont love the piano beat, the percussion and kicks are great though",
    "The flow of rapper is just fine I think there is plenty of room for improvement in making his flow more interesting though",
    "His voice is fine",
    "Chorus is kind of boring",
    "I think the whole song is pretty monotonous",
    "Its a solid song that does not take any risk which is why its rather boring",
    "There is no build-up, climaxes, beat switch-ups, features, or any other method that would create some variation",
    "Furthermore, I think the piano melody is of insufficient quality to be played throughout the whole song",
    "In conclusion, I think this is a song that got the basics down and now the artist in his next songs needs to be more creative and put more effort in making an ",
    "Interesting",
    "Song that stands out from other songs - to give a reason to listen to it",
    "Nice fading in the beginning - good introduction",
    "Dont really like the rap",
    "The song has a nice energy, a pretty and calm vibe",
    "The chorus sounds pretty good - reminds me a little bit of Michael Jackson",
    "I think the songs biggest downfall right now is the (voice) of the rapper - although his flow also leaves me unimpressed",
    "The singing is good, and the production of the music is great as well",
    "Its a pretty refreshing and original song",
    "I will not add it, though, because I dont think my listeners will like it quite enough",
    "To start off, I really like the melody and the song has a nice smooth introduction",
    "The rapper has a nice flow throughout the song and switches it up plenty",
    "The chorus is nice and catchy",
    "The vocalists voice has room for improvement",
    "The production of the whole song sounds very professional",
    "There is a good bassline, the mixing/mastering sounds very good, and honestly, I really like the melody",
    "I think the song is almost good enough for my playlist, but falls just short, because I think the voice is just not there yet",
    "Everything besides that is really good quality, from the writing of the song to the production",
    "Nice soft beginning",
    "Piano and voice work nicely together",
    "I really like the voice its beautiful",
    "The song has a nice calming vibe",
    "I like when the kicks eventually kick in but the harmonious singing left me slightly unimpressed",
    "Not that harmonious singing was inappropriate there, I just thought it could be executed better",
    "Furthermore, during the song, espescially at the end, I was still waiting for more of a climax that never really happened",
    "Regardless, I think it is a very solid song, that I would enjoy listening to for example on a walk through a forest",
    "I really like the voice and I like the melody and vibe the song has",
    "I especially like the drop into the chorus with the ",
    "I see a big red flag waving",
    "I think the second part of the chorus - the Oh-oh, oh-oh part is somewhat underwhelming and anti-climactic considering how good the first halve of the chorus is",
    "I think the song is great, maybe a bit cheesy, because of the lyrics",
    "It reminds me a lot me of Taylor Swifts music - which is kinda my guilty pleasure music",
    "I was shocked to see how few listens the song has yet - it definitely deserves much much more listens",
    "I will be saving this one to my personal songs",
    "This song is fire",
    "The voice of the rapper is good and the flow is fresh and interesting",
    "Cadence is dynamic, love how he goes from talking to shouting and vice versa, keeps it fresh",
    "The lyrics are fun as well, though a bit abrasive",
    "The song sounds original",
    "The chorus gets me hype",
    "I like the melody",
    "The relaxing serene melody forms a nice contrast with the high-energy rapper",
    "Personally, I would make the intro less goofy",
    "Ad-libs are great and get you hype as well",
    "Love the designer pprahhhh adlib",
    "And the pah pah pah pah",
    "The more I play it the more I like it",
    "It definitely gets you hype and I think this is my favorite song I have reviewed so far",
    "Keep it up, this joint was fire!	",
    "The rapper has a nice voice with a lot of energy",
    "His rap is good as well",
    "I liked how he started the verse with Mirror, mirror in the wall",
    "I do think the song lacks variation",
    "The whole song is kind of on the same energy/speed and the arpeggio gets repetitive",
    "There are little drops, build-ups, slow downs, beat changes",
    "I would have made the beat during the hook/chorus more different from the beat during the verses, or maybe have some sort of bridge that stands out from the beat",
    "Right now, any point in the songs sounds like any other point",
    "I think there is some room for improvement for the rapper",
    "At times, its pretty hard to understand what the rapper is saying",
    "I like how the chorus is short and mostly just lets the beat ride with few words",
    "Regarding the production, I think the bassline is great, catchy",
    "The big amount of kicks at the end of the loop, at times, make it sound a bit chaotic, though",
    "On the other hand, it does give the beat a nice bounce and make it energetic",
    "Thats the trade-off, I suppose",
    "This song is too high-energy for my laidback vibes-playlist so I cant add it",
    "I like how the songs has energy from the very beginning",
    "I dont really like the vocals, to be completely honest",
    "The song itself has a nice vibe and a lot of good energy",
    "I think the drops are enjoyable as well - minus the background ad-libs (Hey",
    ") which I dislike",
    "I think the biggest problems of the song are the vocals",
    "I think there is a lot of room for improvement for the rapper, as well as the vocalist doing the chorus",
    "I mean, the chorus is written just fine - I just dislike the voice - this could be a personal thing though",
    "the rapper could definitely improve on things besides his voice - like make his flow more interesting"]
